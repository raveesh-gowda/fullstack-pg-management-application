## Frontend
The frontend of this repository is built using React JS and Redux. The application level state has been maintained in Redux store and api calls were made in the action generator file. The frontend of this web application allows user to register and login only if the validations are passed. Routing part has been carried out to switch between the pages. CRUD operations were performed in the building, rooms and tenants pages respectively.
